       "'The Iliad of Homer \\n\\n\\n\\ntest; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of \\nhistorical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious \\nand exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we must \\nknow more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an \\ninduction of extended experience, is the best help to the criticism \\nof human history. Historical characters can only be estimated \\nby the standard which human experience, whether actual or \\ntraditionary, has furnished. To form correct views of individuals \\nwe must regard them as forming parts of a great whole — we must \\nmeasure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom \\n[x] they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their \\n\\nlives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we \\nmust rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, \\nthan the respective probability of its details. \\n\\nIt is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we \\nknow least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere 1 \\n\\n1 \"What,\" says Archdeacon Wilberforce, \"is the natural root of loyalty as \\ndistinguished from such mere selfish desire of personal security as is apt to take \\nits place in civilized times, but that consciousness of a natural bond among the \\nfamilies of men which gives a fellow-feeling to whole clans and nations, and \\nthus enlists their affections in behalf of those time-honoured representatives of \\ntheir ancient blood, in whose success they feel a personal interest? Hence the \\ndelight when we recognize an act of nobility or justice in our hereditary princes \\n\\n\\'\"Tuque prior, tu parce genus qui ducis Olympo, \\nProjice tela manu sanguis meus\\' \\n\\n\"So strong is this feeling, that it regains an engrafted influence even when \\nhistory witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and weakened it and the \\nCeltic feeling towards the Stuarts has been rekindled in our own days towards \\nthe grand daughter of George the Third of Hanover. \\n\\n\"Somewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those great \\nlawgivers of man\\'s race, who have given expression, in the immortal language \\nof song, to the deeper inspirations of our nature. The thoughts of Homer \\nor of Shakespere are the universal inheritance of the human race. In this \\nmutual ground every man meets his brother, they have been bet forth by the \\nprovidence of God to vindicate for all of us what nature could effect, and \\nthat, in these representatives of our race, we might recognize our common \\nbenefactors.\\' — Doctrine of the Incarnation, pp. 9, 10. \\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION. \\n\\n\\n\\nxiii \\n\\n\\n\\nhave, perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment \\nof mankind than any other three writers who could be named, \\nand yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean \\nof discussion, which has left us little save the option of choosing \\nwhich theory or theories we will follow. The personality of \\nShakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow \\nus to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, \\neven down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of \\ndoubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the \\ncontradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He \\nwas one of the dramatis personae in two dramas as unlike in \\nprinciples as in style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions \\nas different in their tone as those of the writers who have handed \\nthem down. When we have read Plato or Xenophon, we think \\nwe know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and \\nexamined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse \\nthan ignorant. \\n\\nIt has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to \\ndeny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life \\nand condition were too much for our belief. This system — which \\nhas often comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the \\nconsolations of Strauss for those of the New Testament — has \\nbeen of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last \\nand present centuries. To question the existence of Alexander \\nthe Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in \\nthat of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because \\nit is inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian \\ninscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is more \\npardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old king whom \\nthe elegant pen of Florian has idealized — Numa Pompilius. \\n\\nScepticism has attained its culminating point with respect \\nto Homer, and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be \\ndescribed as a free permission to believe any theory, provided \\nwe throw overboard all written tradition, concerning the author [xi] \\n\\n\\n\\nxiv \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Iliad of Homer \\n\\n\\n\\nor authors of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few authorities exist \\non the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the arguments \\nappear to run in a circle. \"This cannot be true, because it is not \\ntrue; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true.\" Such seems \\nto be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement \\nupon statement, is consigned to denial and oblivion. \\n\\nIt is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies \\nof Homer are partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and \\nimagination, in which truth is the requisite most wanting. Before \\ntaking a brief review of the Homeric theory in its present \\nconditions, some notice must be taken of the treatise on the Life \\nof Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus. \\n\\nAccording to this document, the city of Cumae in iEolia, was, \\nat an early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various \\nparts of Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son \\nof Ithagenes. Although poor, he married, and the result of the \\nunion was a girl named Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at \\nan early age, under the guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It \\nis to the indiscretion of this maiden that we \"are indebted for \\nso much happiness.\" Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile \\nfrailty, and received the name of Melesigenes, from having been \\nborn near the river Meles, in Boeotia, whither Critheis had been \\ntransported in order to save her reputation. \\n\\n\"At this time,\" continues our narrative, \"there lived at Smyrna \\na man named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, \\nnot being married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, \\nand spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic \\nlabours. So satisfactory was her performance of this task, and \\nso modest her conduct, that he made proposals of marriage, \\ndeclaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her \\nson, who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were \\ncarefully brought up. \" \\n\\nThey were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents \\nwhich nature had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed \\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION. \\n\\n\\n\\nxv \\n\\n\\n\\nhis schoolfellows in every attainment, and, when older, rivalled \\nhis preceptor in wisdom. Phemius died, leaving him sole heir \\nto his property, and his mother soon followed. Melesigenes \\ncarried on his adopted father\\'s school with great success, exciting \\nthe admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also \\nof the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in \\nthe exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these \\nvisitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, \\nwho evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those \\ntimes, persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany \\nhim on his travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but \\nto furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that, \"While he was \\nyet young, it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the \\ncountries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his \\ndiscourses.\" Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron, \\n\"examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and \\ninforming himself of everything by interrogating those whom he \\nmet.\" We may also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he [xii] \\ndeemed worthy of preservation 2 Having set sail from Tyrrhenia \\nand Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had \\nalready suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes, \\nwho was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical \\nsuperintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of \\nAlcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes \\nrapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, \\nwhich afterwards formed the subject of the Odyssey. The \\ninhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it was here that Melesigenes \\nbecame blind, but the Colophomans make their city the seat of \\n\\n\\n\\n2 Eikos de min aen kai mnaemoruna panton grapherthai.

He then returned to Smyrna, where he applied \\nhimself to the study of poetry. 3 \\n\\nBut poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over \\nthe Hermaean plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, \\na colony of Cumae. Here his misfortunes and poetical talent \\ngained him the friendship of one Tychias, an armourer. \"And up \\nto my time,\" continued the author, \"the inhabitants showed the \\nplace where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses, \\nand they greatly honoured the spot. Here also a poplar grew, \\nwhich they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived\". 4 \\n\\nBut poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, \\nas being the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, \\nhe composed an epitaph on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which \\nhas however, and with greater probability, been attributed to \\n\\n\\n\\n3 — I.e. both of composing and reciting verses for as Blair observes, \"The \\nfirst poets sang their own verses.\" Sextus Empir. adv.

The bard was provided with a harp on which he played a \\nprelude, to elevate and inspire his mind, and with which he accompanied the \\nsong when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium between singing \\nand recitation; the words, and not the melody were regarded by the listeners, \\nhence it was necessary for him to remain intelligible to all.

But setting aside the fact that we must not expect \\nconsistency in a mere romance, the ancients had a superstitious belief in the \\ngreat age of trees which grew near places consecrated by the presence of gods \\nand great men. See Cicero de Legg II I, sub init., where he speaks of the plane \\ntree under which Socrates used to walk and of the tree at Delos, where Latona \\ngave birth to Apollo.

They avowed their willingness to support [xiii] \\nhim in the measure he proposed, and procured him an audience \\nin the council. Having made the speech, with the purport of \\nwhich our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left \\nthem to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal. \\n\\nThe greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the \\npoet\\'s demand, but one man observed that \"if they were to feed \\nHomers, they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless \\npeople.\" \"From this circumstance,\" says the writer, \"Melesigenes \\nacquired the name of Homer, for the Cumans call blind men \\nHomers. \" 7 With a love of economy, which shows how similar \\nthe world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the \\npension was denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a \\nwish that Cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving \\nit renown and glory. \\n\\nAt Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary \\ndistress. One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical \\ngenius, kept Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, \\non condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name.

At his departure, Homer is said to \\nhave observed: \"O Thestorides, of the many things hidden from \\nthe knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible than the \\nhuman heart.\" 8 \\n\\nHomer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until \\nsome Chian merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they \\nheard him recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides \\nwas pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very \\nsame poems. This at once determined him to set out for Chios. \\nNo vessel happened then to be setting sail thither, but he found \\none ready to Start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia, which faces \\nthat island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to \\naccompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a favourable \\nwind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture \\nof Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn \\ndown the wrath of Jove the Hospitable. \\n\\nAt Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had \\nknown him in Phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after \\nsome difficulty, reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met \\nwith an adventure, which we will continue in the words of our \\nauthor. \"Having set out from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted \\nby the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The dogs barked \\non his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was the \\nname of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off \\nhis dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For or some time \\n[xiv] he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such \\n\\na place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then \\n\\n8 Thestorides, thnetoisin anoiston poleon per, ouden aphrastoteron peletai \\nnoou anthropoisin. Ibid. p. 315.

Homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his \\nmisfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and \\nled him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him sup. 9 \\n\\n\"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, \\naccording to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed \\nGlaucus thus: O Glaucus, my friend, pry thee attend to my \\nbehest. First give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut: for \\nso it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast \\nwill approach the fold. \\n\\nGlaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its \\nauthor. Having finished supper, they banqueted 10 afresh on \\nconversation, Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the \\ncities he had visited. \\n\\nAt length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, \\nGlaucus resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with \\nhis meeting with Homer. Having left the goats in charge of \\na fellow-servant, he left Homer at home, promising to return \\nquickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near the farm, and \\nfinding his mate, he told him the whole story respecting Homer \\nand his journey. He paid little attention to what he said, and \\nblamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed \\nand enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger \\nto him. \\n\\n9 This is so pretty a picture of early manners and hospitality, that it is almost \\na pity to find that it is obviously a copy from the Odyssey. See the fourteenth \\nbook. In fact, whoever was the author of this fictitious biography, he showed \\nsome tact in identifying Homer with certain events described in his poems, and \\nin eliciting from them the germs of something like a personal narrative. \\n\\n10 Dia logon estionto.

It is on the coast, at some distance from \\nthe city, northward, and appears to have been an open temple of \\nCybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the \\n[xv] centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. \\n\\nShe is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a lion carved \\non each side, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low rim, \\nor seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the \\nmountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote \\nantiquity.\" \\n\\nSo successful was this school, that Homer realised a \\nconsiderable fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of \\nwhom died single, the other married a Chian. \\n\\nThe following passage betrays the same tendency to connect \\nthe personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which \\nhas already been mentioned: — \\n\\n\"In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude \\n\\n11 It was at Bolissus, and in the house of this Chian citizen, that Homer is said \\nto have written the Batrachomyomachia, or Battle of the Frogs and Mice, the \\nEpicichlidia, and some other minor works. \\n\\n12 Chandler, Travels, vol. i. p. 61, referred to in the Voyage Pittoresque dans \\nla Grece, vol. i. P. 92, where a view of the spot is given of which the author \\ncandidly says, — \"Je ne puis repondre d\\'une exactitude scrupuleuse dans la \\nvue generale que j\\'en donne, car etant alle seul pour r examiner je perdis mon \\ncrayon, et je fus oblige de m\\'en fier a ma memoire. Je ne crois cependant pas \\navoir trop a me plaindre d\\'elle en cette occasion.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION. \\n\\n\\n\\nxxi \\n\\n\\n\\ntowards Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has \\ninserted in his poem as the companion of Ulysses, 13 in return \\nfor the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness. He \\nalso testifies his gratitude to Phemius, who had given him both \\nsustenance and instruction.\" \\n\\nHis celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised \\nhim to visit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. \\nHaving, it is said, made some additions to his poems calculated \\nto please the vanity of the Athenians, of whose city he had \\nhitherto made no mention, 14 he sent out for Samos. Here being \\nrecognized by a Samian, who had met with him in Chios, he \\nwas handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the \\nApaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave great \\nsatisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon \\nfestivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, \\nwith whose children he was very popular. \\n\\nIn the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of \\nIos, now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that \\nhis death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel \\nan enigma proposed by some fishermen\\'s children. 15 \\n\\nSuch is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer \\nwe possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical \\nworthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out \\nin detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to \\nwhich a persevering, patient, and learned — but by no means \\nconsistent — series of investigations has led. In doing so, I profess \\nto bring forward statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness \\n\\n13 A more probable reason for this companionship, and for the character of \\nMentor itself, is given by the allegorists, viz.: the assumption of Mentor\\'s form \\nby the guardian deity of the wise Ulysses, Minerva. The classical reader may \\ncompare Plutarch, Opp. t. ii. p. 880; Xyland. Heraclid. Pont. Alleg. Horn. p. \\n531-5, of Gale\\'s Opusc. Mythol. Dionys. Halic. de Horn.

Compare Mackenzie\\'s note, p. xxx. \\n\\n\\n\\nxxii \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Iliad of Homer \\n\\n\\n\\nor probability. \\n\\n\"Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is \\nlost in doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first \\nminds who have done honour to humanity, because they rose \\namidst darkness. The majestic stream of his song, blessing and \\nfertilizing, flows like the Nile, through many lands and nations; \\nand, like the sources of the Nile, its fountains will ever remain \\n[xvi] concealed.\" \\n\\nSuch are the words in which one of the most judicious \\nGerman critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which \\nthe whole of the Homeric question is involved. With no less truth \\nand feeling he proceeds: — \\n\\n\"It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than \\nthe nature of things makes possible. If the period of tradition \\nin history is the region of twilight, we should not expect in it \\nperfect light. The creations of genius always seem like miracles, \\nbecause they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach \\nof observation. If we were in possession of all the historical \\ntestimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad \\nand the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points, must \\nhave remained the secret of the poet.\" 16 \\n\\nFrom this criticism, which shows as much insight into the \\ndepths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of \\nscholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at \\nissue. Was Homer an individual? 17 or were the Iliad and Odyssey \\nthe result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier \\npoets? \\n\\nWell has Landor remarked: \"Some tell us there were twenty \\nHomers; some deny that there was ever one. It were idle and \\nfoolish to shake the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle \\nat last. We are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our \\ncomposure, our devotion to superior power. Of all the animals \\n\\n\\n\\nHeeren\\'s Ancient Greece, p. 96. \\n\\nCompare Sir E. L.

My opinion is, that \\nwhat is best for us is our admiration of good. No man living \\nvenerates Homer more than I do.\" 18 \\n\\nBut, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which \\nrests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses \\nhad been nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the \\nvividness of first impressions by minute analysis — our editorial \\noffice compels us to give some attention to the doubts and \\ndifficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to \\nentreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to \\nhis imagination, and to condescend to dry details. \\n\\nBefore, however, entering into particulars respecting the \\nquestion of this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) \\nI must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in \\nthe following remarks: — \\n\\n\"We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by \\nthe better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony \\nto its original composition. It was not till the age of the \\ngrammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question; \\nnor is it injustice to assert, that the minute and analytical spirit \\nof a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound \\nfeeling, the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole. \\nThe most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry \\nof the human frame: and we would take the opinion of Chantrey \\nor Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form, \\nrather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper. [xvii] \\n\\n\"There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in \\nthe lines of Pope. — \\n\\n\\'\"The critic eye — that microscope of wit \\nSees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit, \\nHow parts relate to parts, or they to whole \\nThe body\\'s harmony, the beaming soul, \\n\\n\\n\\nPericles and Aspasia, Letter lxxxiv., Works, vol ii. p. 387. \\n\\n\\n\\nxxiv \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Iliad of Homer \\n\\n\\n\\nAre things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see, \\nWhen man\\'s whole frame is obvious to a flea.\\'\" 19 \\n\\nLong was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of \\nquestioning the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. \\nThe grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation \\nthe Hymn to Apollo, 20 the authenticity of which has been \\nalready disclaimed by modern critics. Longinus, in an oft quoted \\npassage, merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative \\ninferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad, 21 and, among a mass \\nof ancient authors, whose very names 22 it would be tedious to \\ndetail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever \\narose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our \\nearly ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries \\nto which more modern investigations lay claim. \\n\\nAt the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun \\nto awaken on the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that \\n\\n19 Quarterly Review, No. lxxxvii., p. 147. \\n\\n20 Viz., the following beautiful passage, for the translation of which I am \\nindebted to Coleridge, Classic Poets, p. 286. \\n\\n\"Origias, farewell! and oh! remember me \\nHereafter, when some stranger from the sea, \\nA hapless wanderer, may your isle explore, \\nAnd ask you, maid, of all the bards you boast, \\nWho sings the sweetest, and delights you most \\nOh! answer all, — A blind old man and poor \\nSweetest he sings — and dwells on Chios\\' rocky shore.\\'\" \\n\\nSee Thucyd. iii, 104. \\n\\n21 Longin., de Sublim., ix. Section 26. Othen en tae Odysseia pareikasai tis \\nan kataduomeno ton Omaeron haelio, oo dixa taes sphodrotaetos paramenei to \\nmegethos \\n\\n22 See Tatian, quoted in Fabric. Bibl. Gr. v. II t. ii. Mr. Mackenzie has given \\nthree brief but elaborate papers on the different writers on the subject, which \\ndeserve to be consulted. See Notes and Queries, vol. v. pp. 99, 171, and 221. \\nHis own views are moderate, and perhaps as satisfactory, on the whole, as any \\nof the hypotheses hitherto put forth. In fact, they consist in an attempt to blend \\nthose hypotheses into something like consistency, rather than in advocating \\n'"
